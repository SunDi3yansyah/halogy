This guide provides the basic steps needed in order to get Halogy running on your server. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUICK START GUIDE\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Download the latest repository from https://code.google.com/p/halogy/\r\n2. Extract the contents in to your Web Root folder (including the '/static' folder, 'index.php' and the '.htaccess' files).\r\n3. Run the provided SQL dump in your MySQL database.\r\n4. Configure your database settings in the '/halogy/config/database.php' file.\r\n\r\n-- NOTE: At this point Halogy should run on your domain, but for security reasons we suggest you continue --\r\n\r\n5. Move the '/halogy' outside of the Web Root, for example in to the parent directory, or a Code repository folder.\r\n6. Edit the 'index.php' file, go to line 63, and change the path to your new system folder (e.g. '../halogy').\r\n\r\n-- TESTING A NEW SITE --\r\n\r\n7. Go to 'mydomain.com/admin'.\r\n8. Login with the default superuser account: (superuser / super123).\r\n9. Change your superuser password to a more secure password and then create a website administrator by clicking on Users.\r\n\r\nYou should now be good to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER CONFIGURATIONS\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nBecause Halogy is built upon the amazing CodeIgniter framework (http://codeigniter.com), you can easily extend and modify Halogy to\r\nyour hearts content. There are also configurations you can make to Halogy using the standard CodeIgniter configuration files, for\r\nexample the database.php (in /halogy/config), the config.php (for character encoding and compression settings), etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULES\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll find the built-in modules everything you'll need for your sites, however you are free to build your own modules by\r\njust building mini-applications (see the CodeIgniter and HMVC documentation) and dropping them in to the Modules folder inside the\r\nApplication. You can then access the modules by going to yoursite.com/module.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
